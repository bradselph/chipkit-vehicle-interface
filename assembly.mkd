Make sure you've purchased all of the required [parts](/hardware.html) before

    <h2>OBD-II Cable</h2>
</div>

</div>

If you plan to use an enclosure, slide the round grommet onto the bare wire end
of the cable (you won't be able to do this later without cutting a slit in the
grommet).  If you don't use the grommet, plan on finding another form of strain
relief.  Cut a section of 3/8" shrink tubing about 1" long and slide it onto
the cable.

Crimp a female pin onto the following wires and verify the connection to the
expected pin on the OBD-II connector using a multimeter. The pinout for the
cable recommended above is available at [OBD2Cables.com][obd2].

</div>

Take note that the crimp pins need to be squeezed in two places (ideally with a
proper [crimp tool](http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1929)) - once around
the wire end, and once around the insulation.

</div>

These instructions describe how to make a 3 bus cable. The chipKIT only has 2
CAN controllers, so you will be using at most 2 of the buses at one time. Most
vehicles use what we will call the `CAN1` and `CAN2-1` buses.

When all pins are attached, verify that you have good electrical conductivity
with the intended pin.

</div>

After connecting and testing the crimp pins, trim the red (battery voltage) and
black (ground) wires down to the insulation but leave them sticking out of the
main cable insulation. If you want to power the chipKIT from the vehicle in the
future, you'll need these wires.

Trim all of the other uncrimped wires down to the main cable insulation - we
won't be needing them.

<div class="page-header">
    <h3>Crimp Housings</h3>
</div>

1. Connect each of the `CAN1`, `CAN2-1` and `CAN2-2` wire pairs (see the table
   above) to one crimp pin housing each. There should be three crimp housings
   with two wires connected to each. The `+` in pin 1 and `-` in pin 3 (you'll
   see in the schematic below that pins 2 and 4 will also work fine).
1. Optionally, make and attach small labels for `CAN1`, `CAN2-1`, `CAN2-2` and
   three `-+`'s to make sure you get the orientation correct.

</div>

Slide the shrink tubing and center it on the end of the insulation. Bend the
red/black power wires and tuck them between the shrink tubing and main cable
insulation. Leave the loop accessible to allow us to pull them free in the
future. With a heat gun or lighter, shrink the tubing. If you don't have shrink
tubing, wrap some electrical tape around the end to keep the loose wires held
down.

    <h2 id="power-jumper"><a href="#power-jumper">Power Jumper</a></h2>
</div>

1. Cut a length of wire, 2" to 3" long.
2. Strip about an 1/8" on both ends.
3. Crimp a female pin to one end and a male to the other.

<div class="picture well">
    <img src="/images/assembly/openxc-assembly-8.jpg" />

</div>

<div class="picture well">

</div>

Put a 1x1 housing on the female end.

*If not building the enclosure:*

Put a 1x1 housing on the male end, too.

*If building the enclosure:*

Put shrink tubing on the male end, enough to cover a bit of the insulation and
most of the crimp pin that will not actually get pushed into the socket. Put a
bend in the crimp pin about halfway between the pin and the wire, otherwise it
won't fit in the enclosure. Rather than a single 90 degree bend, put in two
bends of 45 degrees. Don't make either of those bends on the skinny pin, put
them both on the thicker body of the crimp pin.

The reason for this is that a plastic housing will be too tall to fit inside the
recommended case.

1. Connect the `CAN1` plug on the OBD-II cable to the 12-pin header labeled
  `CAN1` on the Network Shield. Make sure the 2 wires line up with the `CANH`
  and `CANL` labels on the board as well.
1. Connect the `CAN2-1` plug on the OBD-II cable to the 12-pin header labeled
  `CAN2` on the Network Shield.

1. Connect the female end of the power jumper to pin 1 of JP4. Connect the male
  end to 5vo on the POWER connector.

At this point, the reader should be completely functional. But without an
enclosure, it is at risk of static shock damage and strain damage in the event
of a drop. There are many potential enclosures that will be adequate for this
device.

If you want wireless support, now is the time to add a Bluetooth module. We have
[setup instructions](/bluetooth.html) for the [SparkFun
BlueSMiRF](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10269).

<div class="page-header">
    <h2>Vehicle Power</h2>
</div>

The Vehicle Interface can be powered from the vehicle 12V power lines as seen
below - connect 12v to `Vin` and ground to...`GND`.

<div class="page-header">
    <h2>Optional Enclosure</h2>
</div>

If you are using the recommended PacTec enclosure, it requires a few modifications.

<div class="page-header">
    <h2>Lower Enclosure</h2>
</div>

1. Remove the four existing raised screw sockets from the inside bottom of
   enclosure. A pair of angle cutters should do the trick.
2. While holding the chipKIT on the enclosure's lower half, use a pen to mark
  where the new mounting holes should go. They are asymmetrical, so they
  definitely won't line up with the existing holes. Remove the chipKIT and drill
  four new screw holes in the bottom of the enclosure.

    <legend>Clipping off the existing raised screw sockets.</legend>

    <img src="/images/assembly/openxc-assembly-12.jpg"/>
    <legend>The empty enclosure with new mounting holes drilled.</legend>
</div>

1. Put screws into the 4 holes from below the enclosure. Place the enclosure
   down on a table so the screws are kept in place while you insert the chipKIT.
2. Mount the Network Shield on the Max32.
3. Fit the Max32 onto the 4 screws. Again, the mounting holes are asymmetrical,
   so it should only fit one way.
4. Screw round stand-offs onto the screws. Tighten by holding stand-offs with
   needle-nose pliers while tightening the other side with a screwdriver. Be
   careful on the two screws nearest the Ethernet port - these don't have much
   support, and the Network Shield could be damaged by over tightening.

<div class="page-header">
    <h2>Front Plate</h2>
</div>

1. Using the [template](/documents/CAN-Reader-Front-Panel-Template.pdf), drill a
   hole for the OBD-II cable.
1. Trim the OBD-II cable hole and shape it with a round file.
1. Using the template, drill out and shape the hole for the USB cable using a
  straight file.

<div class="page-header">
    <h2 id="final-assembly"><a href="#final-assembly">Final Assembly</a></h2>
</div>

1. Complete the <a href="#electrical-assembly">Electrical Assembly</a> as described above.
1. Slide the grommet to about where the front plate will be. Put the front plate
  on the grommet. Lay the cable flat on the outside of the Ethernet jack. Bend
  the cable between the standoff and the power connector, being careful to put
  as little strain as possible on the small wires of the 2x6 connectors. Push
  the front plate into place.

<div class="picture well">
    <img src="/images/assembly/openxc-assembly-18.jpg" />
    <legend>Front plate and cable grommet installation.</legend>
</div>

1. Put the back plate into place and attach the top of the enclosure.
1. Secure the enclosure with the two screws.
1. Affix the four rubber feet to the underside just to the outside of the four
   mounting screws.  (This will prevent scratches from the exposed screws.)
1. Attach the hook-side Velcro to the underside, leaving the enclosure screws
  accessible.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

Once you've constructed a vehicle interface, you go through the [test
procedure][testing] to make sure it's working correctly.
